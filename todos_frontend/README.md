# To-Do App with React, Node.js, and Electron

This project is a comprehensive To-Do application that leverages the power of modern web technologies to provide a seamless experience across web and desktop platforms. It utilizes React for a dynamic and responsive frontend, Node.js with Express for a robust and scalable backend, MongoDB for persistent data storage, and Electron to package the React application as a native desktop application.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js** (version >= 18 recommended) and **npm** (Node Package Manager)
* **MongoDB** (ensure the MongoDB server is running)

### Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:



## Backend Setup (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd todos_backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install express mongoose cors dotenv
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `todos_backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```
    Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with the actual URI of your MongoDB database.

4.  **Review backend files:**
    Ensure that your `server.js` file sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB using Mongoose, and defines your API routes. You should also have `Group.js` and `Task.js` (or similar) in the `models` directory defining your MongoDB schemas.

5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will typically run at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Frontend Setup (React + Axios)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../todos_frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install axios react-router-dom
    ```

3.  **Implement frontend components:**
    Develop your React components in the `src` directory. You'll likely have components for displaying groups and tasks (`GroupList.js`), handling user input, and managing the overall application state (`App.js`). Ensure you are using Axios to make API calls to your backend server.

4.  **Start the React development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will launch the frontend application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Available Scripts (in `todos_frontend` directory)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

* **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) for more information.

* **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! For more information, see the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment).

* **`npm run eject`**: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. It will copy all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. Once ejected, you are fully responsible for maintaining these configurations. You don't have to use eject, as the curated feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments.

## Electron Setup

To package the React frontend as a desktop application using Electron:

1.  **Navigate back to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../todos_frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Electron as a development dependency:**
    ```bash
    npm install electron --save-dev
    ```

3.  **Create the Electron entry point:**
    Create a file named `electron.js` inside the `public` folder of your `todos_frontend` directory. This file will contain the main Electron process code to create and manage the browser window that will load your React application.

    ```javascript
    // public/electron.js
    const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
    const path = require('path');
    const isDev = require('electron-is-dev');

    function createWindow() {
      const win = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        webPreferences: {
          nodeIntegration: false, // Recommended for security
          contextIsolation: true, // Recommended for security
          preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'), // Optional: for more secure context bridge
        },
      });

      win.loadURL(
        isDev
          ? 'http://localhost:3000'
          : `file://${path.join(__dirname, '../build/index.html')}`
      );

      if (isDev) {
        win.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 'detach' });
      }
    }

    app.whenReady().then(createWindow);

    app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
      if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
        app.quit();
      }
    });

    app.on('activate', () => {
      if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
        createWindow();
      }
    });
    ```

    You might also want to create a `preload.js` file in the `public` directory for a more secure context bridge if you need to expose Node.js APIs to your renderer process.

4.  **Update `package.json` in the `todos_frontend` directory:**
    Add the `main` entry point and an `electron` script to your `scripts` section:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "todos_frontend",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "private": true,
      "dependencies": {
        "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
        "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
        "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
        "axios": "^1.6.7",
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
        "react-router-dom": "^6.22.1",
        "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
        "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "build": "react-scripts build",
        "test": "react-scripts test",
        "eject": "react-scripts eject",
        "electron": "electron ."
      },
      "eslintConfig": {
        "extends": [
          "react-app",
          "react-app/jest"
        ]
      },
      "browserslist": {
        "production": [
          ">0.2%",
          "not dead",
          "not op_mini all"
        ],
        "development": [
          "last 1 chrome version",
          "last 1 firefox version",
          "last 1 safari version"
        ]
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "electron": "^29.0.1",
        "electron-is-dev": "^2.0.0"
      },
      "main": "public/electron.js"
    }
    ```

5.  **Run Electron:**
    ```bash
    npm run electron
    ```
    This command will first start your React development server (if it's not already running) and then open your React application within an Electron window.

## Deployment

### Web Deployment (Frontend & Backend)

For production deployment of the web version of your application:

* **Frontend (React):** You can build your React application using `npm run build` in the `todos_frontend` directory. The resulting `build` folder can then be deployed to various static hosting providers like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or a traditional web server.

* **Backend (Node.js/Express):** You can deploy your Node.js backend to platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud App Engine, or a virtual private server (VPS). Ensure your environment variables (especially the MongoDB connection string) are correctly configured on the production server.

### Desktop Application Deployment (Electron)

To package your Electron application for distribution:

* **Electron Packager:** A simple command-line tool to package Electron apps. You can install it globally with `npm install -g electron-packager`. Then, from the `todos_frontend` directory, you can run a command like:
    ```bash
    npx electron-packager . your-app-name --platform=darwin --arch=x64 --out=dist
    ```
    Replace `your-app-name`, `--platform`, `--arch`, and `--out` with your desired application name, target platform (e.g., `win32`, `linux`, `darwin`), architecture (e.g., `ia32`, `x64`, `arm64`), and output directory.

* **Electron Builder:** A more comprehensive tool that offers more advanced features like auto-updates and creating installers. You can install it as a dev dependency in your `todos_frontend` project: `npm install electron-builder --save-dev`. Then, configure your build settings in your `package.json` and run a build command (e.g., `npx electron-builder --win --mac --linux`).

Refer to the documentation of Electron Packager and Electron Builder for detailed configuration options and platform-specific instructions.
